# Damage Prediction Model: Philippines, Typhoon Goni

The Disaster Analytics for Society Lab (DASL) at the Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore has developed a damage prediction model for the areas in the Philippines affected by Typhoon Goni, which made landfall on UTC 31 Oct 2020. Using damage data from past typhoons in the Philippines collected from the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) and the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC), DASL has calibrated a data-driven damage model to predict the proportion (and total) of damaged houses at the municipality level. 

In this GitHub repository, the GoniDamageModel folder contains the input and output data, as well as the code needed to select and run the model. The Windspeed folder contains the data and code used to obtain the input wind data for Typhoon Goni which is used in the damage model.
